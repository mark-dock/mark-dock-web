# MarkDock Web Repo
This repository stores all the code for the MarkDock web application.

## Documentation
- [Deployment Guide](./docs/deployment.md)
- [CI/CD Pipeline Guide](./docs/ci-cd.md)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mark-dock/mark-dock-web.git
```

2. Verify the API URL in the `.env.development` file. The API URL should be the URL of your local MarkDock API server.

3. Run the docker container with the following command

```bash
docker compose up
```

4. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

5. (Optional) If you are running the application inside WSL and want to access the application from another device on the same network, you
    need to run the following command to get the IP address of the WSL container. (This command will expose the WSL container to the network)

```bash
sudo apt install npm # If you don't have npm installed
npx expose-wsl@latest
```

This will output the IP address of the WSL container. You can now access the application from another device on the same network by navigating to `http://<WSL_IP>:3000`
